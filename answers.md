#Activity 2

###Keywords and Responses
- 1: goat = Give me all the goats
- 2: hat = Give me your hat
- 3: maybe = Why so unsure?

###Question

   1. It will produce the response to that keyword, so for the first one it will produce "Why so negative" and for the other it will           produce "Why so negative" once again. The problem with these statements is that it doesnt actually provide a reasonable repsonse to       the statement because the "no" keyword comes before the "dog" and "cat" keywords in the method getResponses.
